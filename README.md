# key-value-store


In this project it involves implementing a simple encrypted key-value store. The code is  a library of
functions that can be called by other programs, rather than a standalone executable.

The c codes involves creating a binary tree that alllows one to add  values, and supports insertion, deletion and searching. Lastly it involves  implement the dictionary using the B tree data
structure and encrypt stored values using a modified version of the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA).
